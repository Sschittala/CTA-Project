# CTA-Project
There is a provided zip file for the database because the database is large for github to upload it correctly. 

This project displays the output based on 9 different commands. The output starts with a display of the general stats for the database.
The first command finds all the station names that matches the user input.
The second command finds the percentages of the riders on weekdays, Saturdays, sundays/holidays
The third command outputs the data for the total ridership on weekdays for each station with station names
The fourth command outputs all the stops for the user inputted line color in that direction
The fifth command outputs the number of stops for each line color, separated by direction
The sixth command outputs the total ridership for each year for that station
The seventh command outputs the total ridership for each month in the year based on the user inputted station name and year
The eighth command outputs the total ridership for the two stations and for each day in the year that is provided by the user
The ninth command outputs all the stations within a one mile square radius based on the set of latitude and longitudes given by the user
